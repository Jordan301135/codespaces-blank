#Operators
# Operators are a construct (bulid-in system) data types more actions and power



# Arithmetic Operator Family
# Arithmetic operators are simply math opertions

print (2+4)
print (10-10)
print (2/1)
print (20.9*12.34)

#Assignment Operator Family
#these operators assign values to
#variables (otherwise known as containers)
#key / value pairs

schoolName = "Boys Latin"
age = "16"
userName = "jordanwerlls"
password = "98769"
location = "982.38401.7641"
search= "hamburgers"

age += 2 # adding a new value to our variable
age *= 3 # multiplying a new value to our variables

print(age)


# Comparison Operator Family
# Comparison family of operators simply compares values.

print(2>1)
print(100<29)
print("123Abc"" == "123Avbc") # double equal signs means
# its comparing if the values are the same

print(2 !=3) # NOT the same

# Logical Operator Famliy
# it checks and compares if certain code conditions are true.
# are true or false

print (3<1 and "Jordan" == "Jordan")
# the AND operator checks tio see BOTH conditions are true.
# If BOTH are TRUE the answer is true.

(2==1 or 3 > 2)
# The OR operator checks if ONE of the conditions is TRUE.
# So long as ONE of the co=nditions is TRUE, it will be TRUE.

print(not(3>1 and "Jordan" == "Jordan")) # false
# The NOT operator will give the opposite result.
# The NOT operator flips the result,.

password = "SCURRY30"
input = "SCURRY30"

print(password == input)
