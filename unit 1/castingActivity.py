# Problem 1
Name = input('What is your name:')
Age = input('What is your age')
print('Hello my name is' + Name + 'I am' + Age + 'years old')


# Problem 2
#Bonus = '200'
#print(300 + int (Bonus)) # result should be 500

# Problem 3
#Value = 'true'
#print(True == Value) # result should be true

# Hint use w3schools to find a data casting function that will change
# a data type into a boolean
